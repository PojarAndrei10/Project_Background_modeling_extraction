# Background modeling/extraction - Image Processing
This project aims to remove dynamic objects from a video (sequence of images) and display the static background in the image.
We have chosen as background extraction technique the method called Running Average, which is a popular technique in image processing. As an input we can have a sequence of images that actually realize a video clip with different objects that change their position from one image to another (dynamic objects).
Programming language: C++
Image processing library : OpenCV
